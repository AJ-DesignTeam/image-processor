  **Design Movement**: Neumorphism (Soft UI) 2.0
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Tactile Realism**: Elements should feel like they can be touched and pressed, with soft shadows and highlights creating depth.
  2. **Minimalist Clarity**: Focus on the content (images) with a clean, distraction-free interface.
  3. **Soft & Approachable**: Use rounded corners and gentle colors to make the tool feel friendly and easy to use.
  4. **Micro-Interactions**: Subtle animations on hover and click to enhance the tactile feel.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Off-white or light gray (#F0F2F5) to serve as a neutral canvas.
  - **Accents**: Soft blue (#4A90E2) for primary actions, indicating trust and reliability.
  - **Text**: Dark gray (#333333) for readability, avoiding harsh blacks.
  - **Intent**: To create a calming, stress-free environment for processing images, making the task feel effortless.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Card-Based**: Each image is treated as a physical card on a surface.
  - **Floating Controls**: The control panel floats above the content, accessible but not intrusive.
  - **Asymmetric Grid**: Images are arranged in a masonry-style grid to handle different aspect ratios naturally.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Soft Shadows**: Double shadows (light and dark) to create the extruded effect.
  - **Inset Inputs**: Input fields and sliders appear pressed into the surface.
  - **Floating Action Button (FAB)**: A prominent, floating button for the primary action (Download All).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Press & Release**: Buttons simulate physical button presses.
  - **Drag & Drop**: The entire surface feels receptive to dropped files, with a ripple effect on drop.

  **Animation**:
  - **Soft Spring**: All movements use spring physics for a natural, organic feel.
  - **Fade & Scale**: Elements enter with a gentle fade and scale up.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Nunito (Rounded sans-serif) for a friendly, approachable vibe.
  - **Body**: Roboto or Open Sans for clean, legible text.

  **Design Movement**: Cyberpunk / High-Tech Industrial
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Data Visualization**: Treat image data as raw information to be processed.
  2. **High Contrast**: Dark mode by default with neon accents to highlight active elements.
  3. **Modular Interface**: The UI is composed of distinct, functional modules that snap together.
  4. **Precision**: emphasize exact values and technical details.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Deep charcoal or black (#121212).
  - **Accents**: Neon Cyan (#00FFFF) for processing, Neon Magenta (#FF00FF) for alerts.
  - **Text**: Monospace fonts in bright white or terminal green.
  - **Intent**: To make the user feel like a power user operating a sophisticated piece of machinery.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Dashboard**: A dense, information-rich layout with collapsible sidebars.
  - **Split View**: Original vs. Processed comparison side-by-side.
  - **StatusBar**: A persistent status bar at the bottom showing global stats.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitch animations on hover or processing completion.
  - **Grid Lines**: Faint background grid to suggest precision and structure.
  - **Terminal-style Logs**: A log window showing processing steps in real-time.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Instant Feedback**: Immediate visual response to every input.
  - **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Heavy emphasis on keyboard control for efficiency.

  **Animation**:
  - **Snap & Slide**: UI elements snap into place with mechanical precision.
  - **Scanlines**: Scanning effects during image processing.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Rajdhani or Orbitron (Tech/Sci-fi feel).
  - **Body**: JetBrains Mono or Fira Code (Monospace for data).

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style (International Typographic Style)
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Grid Systems**: A strict, mathematical grid governs all layout decisions.
  2. **Asymmetry**: Dynamic, asymmetrical compositions to create visual interest.
  3. **Typography as Image**: Large, bold typography is used as a primary design element.
  4. **Objective Photography**: Images are presented without decoration, letting the content speak.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Base**: Stark White (#FFFFFF).
  - **Accents**: Primary Red (#FF0000) and Black (#000000).
  - **Text**: Black for maximum contrast and legibility.
  - **Intent**: To convey clarity, objectivity, and order. The tool is a neutral vessel for the user's content.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Content aligns strictly to a visible or invisible grid.
  - **Whitespace**: Generous use of whitespace to separate elements and guide the eye.
  - **Typographic Hierarchy**: Size and weight denote importance, not color or decoration.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Rules**: Bold black lines to separate sections.
  - **Oversized Numbers**: Large numerals to indicate steps or stats (e.g., "80%").
  - **Geometric Shapes**: Simple circles or squares for icons and indicators.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Direct & Snappy**: Transitions are instant or very fast linear movements.
  - **Hover Reveal**: Information is revealed on hover to keep the initial view clean.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide**: Elements slide in from the grid lines.
  - **Color Shift**: abrupt color changes on interaction (e.g., black to red).

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: Helvetica Now Display (Bold/Black) for impact.
  - **Body**: Helvetica Now Text (Regular) for neutrality.
